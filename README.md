# Public-Spiders-
Here I have a repository of various webspiders I wrote in python to learn this language and to get some data I am iterested in.

First script's: "get_from_siepomaga" goal was to assess total number of people that need help and total amount of funds required to raise. I regularly add my small brick to the collections organized by siepomaga.
Script gets data from siepomaga web pages, pareses them and saves them to csv file. In order not to overload the server, I added a time delay in requests.
